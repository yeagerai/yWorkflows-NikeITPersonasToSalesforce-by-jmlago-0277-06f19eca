A workflow that scrapes public LinkedIn profiles of Nike IT department employees to obtain their names and emails (if available), and then sends this information to Salesforce. The workflow consists of five main steps: 1) LinkedIn Profile Scraper: scrapes public LinkedIn profiles matching 'Nike' and 'IT department'; 2) Name Extraction: extracts names from the scraped LinkedIn profiles; 3) Email Extraction: extracts email addresses from the scraped LinkedIn profiles, if available; 4) Formatting Data: combines the extracted names and email addresses into a structured format; 5) Salesforce Integration: sends the structured data to Salesforce as new leads.
